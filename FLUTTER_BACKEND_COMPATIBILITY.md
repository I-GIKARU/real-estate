# Flutter App - Backend Compatibility Analysis

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **API URL Configuration**
**Issue**: Flutter app was configured to use `localhost:8080` but production backend is at `https://kenyan-real-estate-backend-671327858247.us-central1.run.app`

**Fix**: Updated `lib/config/api_config.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'https://kenyan-real-estate-backend-671327858247.us-central1.run.app/api/v1';
```

### 2. **User Model Field Mismatch**
**Issue**: Flutter User model expected different field names than backend provides:
- Flutter expected: `is_email_verified` 
- Backend provides: `is_verified`
- Flutter expected: `profile_picture`
- Backend provides: `profile_image_url`

**Fix**: Updated `lib/models/user_model.dart` to match backend field names.

### 3. **Auth Response Parsing Issues**
**Issue**: Flutter AuthService expected nested response structure (`data['data']`) but backend returns data directly.

**Fix**: Updated response parsing in `lib/services/auth_service.dart`:
- Login response: `data['user']` and `data['token']` directly
- Register response: Same structure
- Profile response: `data['user']` directly

### 4. **Missing Refresh Token Handling**
**Issue**: Flutter expected refresh tokens but backend doesn't provide them yet.

**Fix**: Made refresh token optional in AuthResponse model and handle empty strings.

### 5. **Email Verification Integration**
**Issue**: Flutter app didn't handle email verification workflow.

**Fixes**:
- Updated login screen to detect unverified users and show verification dialog
- Updated register screen to show success dialog with verification instructions
- Added proper error handling for verification-related errors

### 6. **User Type Selection Missing**
**Issue**: Register screen didn't have user type selection field.

**Fix**: Added dropdown for user types (tenant, landlord, agent) in register form.

### 7. **Mock vs Real API Integration**
**Issue**: Both login and register screens used mock implementations instead of real API calls.

**Fix**: Replaced mock implementations with proper AuthService integration.

## Current Status

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
- API URL configuration
- User model field mappings
- Auth response parsing
- Email verification workflow
- User registration with proper user type selection
- Real API integration instead of mocks

### ⚠️ Backend Issues Still Present:
1. **Email verification not enforced at login** - Users can login without verification
2. **Production backend needs redeployment** with email verification fixes

## Email Verification Workflow

### Current Backend Behavior:
1. User registers → Gets token immediately + verification email sent
2. User can login without verification ❌ (Should be blocked)
3. Unverified users can access some protected routes ❌ (Should be blocked)

### Intended Workflow:
1. User registers → Gets token + verification email sent
2. User cannot login until email is verified ✅ (Fixed in local code)
3. Unverified users blocked from critical routes ✅ (Fixed in local code)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Backend Changes**: The email verification fixes need to be deployed to production
2. **Test Full Workflow**: Once backend is deployed, test the complete registration/verification/login flow
3. **Add Email Verification Screen**: Consider adding a dedicated verification screen for better UX
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Add handling for expired verification tokens, resend limits, etc.

## Testing Commands

Test login with unverified user:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://kenyan-real-estate-backend-671327858247.us-central1.run.app/api/v1/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "TestPassword123!"}'
```

Expected response after fix deployment:
```json
{
  "error": "Email verification required. Please verify your email before logging in.",
  "verification_required": true,
  "user_email": "test@example.com"
}
```

## Flutter App Testing

After the backend fixes are deployed:

1. Run the Flutter app
2. Register a new user → Should show verification dialog
3. Try to login without verification → Should be blocked with verification message
4. Verify email → Login should work
5. Access protected features → Should work after verification
